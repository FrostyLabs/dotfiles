# FrostyLabs Dotfiles ❄️

Welcome to my personal dotfiles! These are the configs I use every day to keep my terminal fast, clean, and comfortable.

## What’s Inside?
- **.zshrc**: My Zsh shell configuration, aliases, and plugin setup.
- **.tmux.conf**: My Tmux setup for smooth multiplexing and workflow boosts.

## Why These Files?
⚡️I like a terminal that feels responsive and friendly. These configs help keep things tidy while still being powerful enough for daily development. 

## How to Use
1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FrostyLabs/dotfiles.git
   ```
2. Copy or symlink the configs you want:
   ```bash
   ln -s ~/dotfiles/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
   ln -s ~/dotfiles/.tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf
   ```
3. Restart your terminal or reload configs:
   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
   ```

## Extra Notes
Feel free to explore, borrow, or improve anything here. I keep things simple on purpose—but simple doesn’t have to be boring! 😄

Enjoy and happy hacking! 🧊
